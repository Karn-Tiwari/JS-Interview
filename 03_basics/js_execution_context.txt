Types of Execution Context

Global Execution Context
Functional Execution Context
Eval Execution Context


Memory Creation phase
Execution phase

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5

function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1,val2)
let result2 = addNum(20,45)

1.Global Execution Context
1.1 Memory phase
1.2 Execution phase
In Memory phase
    val1 ->undefined
    val2 ->undefined
    addNum ->defination
    result1 ->undefined
    result2 ->undefined
In Execution phase
    val1 ->10
    val2 ->5
    addNum ->   New Variable + Environment + Execution thread and Also it will delete this new Execution Context
    result1 = 15
    result2 = Now it will again create another local Execution context nd in
