let score = "234vdfn"// so for this case we have to think wisely for handling the number value suppose which is coming from any form


console.log(typeof score);
console.log(typeof(score));

let valueInNumber = Number(score)
console.log(typeof valueInNumber);//number
console.log(valueInNumber);// NaN


//1=>true; 0=>false
// "" =>false
//"karn" =>true
